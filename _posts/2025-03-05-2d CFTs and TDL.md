These notes explore the interplay between two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) and generalized symmetries. 
  The motivation of this interplay is shown from the perspective of boundary and interface CFTs,  <!--more-->
  and later on, we  present an axiomatic approach to topological defect 
    lines in CFTs.
  The Ising model is constructed from the standard 2D minimal model, while the defect lines it can
   accommodate are bootstrapped from the modular (defect) bootstrap. The discussion briefly mentions gauging 
   discrete/non-invertible symmetries and their implications.
