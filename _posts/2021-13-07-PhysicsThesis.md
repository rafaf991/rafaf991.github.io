title: "Physics dissertation thesis (not final version)"
description: " Lately, intense discussion regarding measurements in relativistic quantum mechanics has been developed.
We present the Fewster-Verch measuring scheme that allows to address problems of locality
and causality. An explicit example is given with a particular application to model an Unruh-deWitt
type of detector, we compare this results with the traditional approach of the UdW detector, also
given in the work. For the sake of completeness, a traditional, as well as an algebraic derivation
of the Unruh effect is given. The topics treated in this thesis may attract people from diferent
felds such as QMT, QFT and AQFT. We hope the reader and this work as an useful introduction
for those topics and foremost, an interesting review of the Unruh eect and the Fewster and Verch
measurement scheme in relativistic quantum mechanics."
