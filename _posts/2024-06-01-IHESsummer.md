Summer course at the IHES on:
 * Generalized symmetries, Phases of Gauge Theory
 * anomalies in condensed matter physics,
 * Higher Symmetry in Particle Physics.
 <!--more-->
 * Non-invertible symmetries and their relations to anomalies on the lattice.  Kramers-Wannier
              symmetry in the quantum Ising lattice model and its dynamical consequences. Topological
              phases protected by non-invertible symmetries. Example: cluster model.
 * Generalized, non-invertible symmetries in terms of explicit CFT observable. -> Symmetries are
              formalized by fusion categories and their gauging.
 * String Theory, Symmetries and Anomalies and the Green-Schwartz mechanism.
