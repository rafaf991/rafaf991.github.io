Lately intense discussion regarding measurements in relativistic quantum mechanics has been developed. We present the Fewster-Verch measuring scheme that allows to address problems of locality
and causality; an explicit example is given and is used to model an Unruh-deWitt type of detector.
The results are compared with the traditional approach of the UdW detector,
<!--more-->
 which is also given
in the work, and found to be the same under certain considerations. For the sake of completeness
and to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena, a standard as well as an algebraic derivation
of the Unruh effect is given. The topics treated in this thesis may attract people from different
fields such as QMT, QFT and AQFT. We hope the reader find this work as an useful introduction
for those topics and foremost, an interesting review of the Unruh effect and the Fewster and Verch
measurement scheme in relativistic quantum mechanics.
