In this project we observed convergence according to the CLT for a MVS of a distribution Gamma(α, β). The Newton-Rapson method was used to find the maximum likelihood parameters with an error of less than 3 %.
with an error of less than 3 %. The validity of the CLT was verified with several tests.<!--more-->
