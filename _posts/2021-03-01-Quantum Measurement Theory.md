In the pursuit of giving quantum mechanics a mathematical foundation, the measurement of observables was one of the main concerns . It was von Neumann who proposed a mathematical scheme for measurements where a system and a probe are coupled giving a “experimental setup” and, therefore, giving birth to the so called Quantum Measurement Theory (QMT). <!--more--> Even though nowadays QMT is a very robust and active theory, measurements in relativistic quantum theory has not been widely discussed.

 One may think that QMT naturally extends on quantum field theories but it turns out that assumptions of locality have to be addressed and, therefore, if not carefully worked it may lead to a violation of information transport. In this talk the C. Fewster & R. Verch (abstract) scheme of measurements on a quantum field theory is introduced. The scheme uses the natural framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) that allows us address problems of locality and causality. Also, a explicit probe is introduced as an application of the theory where further information can be deduced provided a specific quantum field theory.
