# Ideas
- Integrability and Galois theory (look at notes )
- KMS state and [periodic functions with sum as identity function](https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/math/puzzles/periodic-functions-sum-identity.pdf)
- Rindler, Chern-Simon and blackholes (Alejandra C.) compute the Wilson spools
+ First compute the CS correlation of the 3-linked knot and see it recovers the linking number
- Defects, bootstrap and ising model simulations (Ronald)
