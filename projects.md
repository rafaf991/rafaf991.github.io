# Ideas
- Integrability and Galois theory (look at notes )
- KMS state and [periodic functions with sum as identity function](https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/math/puzzles/periodic-functions-sum-identity.pdf)
- Rindler, Chern-Simon and blackholes (Alejandra C.) compute the Wilson spools
+ First compute the CS correlation of the 3-linked knot and see it recovers the linking number
- Defects, bootstrap and ising model simulations (Ronald)

## Entanglement and Homology
Homology provides a way to classify topological spaces through chain complexes and cycles. In quantum systems, entanglement structures are sometimes associated with the topology of the underlying Hilbert space, 
particularly in topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) or topological quantum computing.
For example, the topological entanglement entropy in 2D systems measures a contribution to the entanglement entropy that depends solely on the topology of the system's ground state.

In quantum information, nCP maps are used to characterize separability (e.g., the partial transpose map in the Peres-Horodecki criterion). These maps act as tools to identify and quantify entanglement in quantum states.
Viewing these maps through the lens of homology might involve representing the action of nCP maps on chain complexes associated with the quantum system. For instance:
How do nCP maps act on the chain complexes representing entanglement structure?
Do cycles or boundaries (from the homological perspective) correspond to physical properties like separability or entanglement measures?
Homology might provide a framework to study the structure of quantum channels, especially those that are not completely positive but have meaningful partial actions (e.g., entanglement-preserving maps).
Derived functors in homological algebra, such as Ext and Tor, could have analogs in studying transformations on quantum systems under nCP dynamics.


### Connections Between Entanglement, nCP Maps, and Homology
The algebra of quantum observables and the corresponding states are often studied through operator algebra cohomology or cyclic homology. These frameworks might extend to include transformations like nCP maps, enriching our understanding of their role in entanglement dynamics.

In higher-dimensional quantum systems, higher homology groups could classify multi-body entanglement. nCP maps might then correspond to specific transformations preserving or altering these higher entanglement structures.
It may be possible to define new homological invariants specifically for entanglement, using chain complexes that encode quantum state overlaps or correlations.
