### Current Research
# Ideas
- Integrability and Galois theory...
- (look at notes windows)
- KMS state and [periodic functions with sum as identity function](https://susam.github.io/blob/lab/math/puzzles/periodic-functions-sum-identity.pdf)
- Rindler, Chern-Simon and blackholes (Alejandra Castro) compute the Wilson spools
