>“Accordingly, we find Euler and D'Alembert devoting their talent and their patience to the establishment of the laws of rotation of the solid bodies. Lagrange has incorporated his own analysis of the problem with his general treatment of mechanics, and since his time M. Poinsot has brought the subject under the power of a more searching analysis than that of the calculus, in which ideas take the place of symbols, and intelligent propositions supersede equations.”
>― James Clerk Maxwell

Hi! I am Rafael Córdoba. I am scientist in physics, mathematics and a professional bread baker! I am highly curious, passionate learner and carefully observer. I am highly interested in academic reseacrh in mathematical Physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, unification theories (String theories) but I have a special spot in my heart for observational astrophysics.
- Good at explaining physics intuitively. 
- Amateur observer of galaxies and planets.
- Amateur chess player
- I like almost any kind of puzzle, if you know a challenging one let me know!
- I love solving challenging problems and to find patterns.
- All kinds of geometry enthusiast.
- Member of the QFT and mathematical physics group in Los Andes University
- Professional bread baker.
